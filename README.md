# Heart Demo CSS

## Description

- This project demonstrates a simple heart shape using HTML and CSS. It showcases CSS animations to create a pulsing heart effect, perfect for adding a fun shape on a web page.

- The heart is created using a div element with `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements to form the top curves of the heart, and CSS animations to add a pulsing effect.
